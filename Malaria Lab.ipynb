    "According to the CDCs [website](https://www.cdc.gov/malaria/about/biology/index.html), the lifecycle of the malaria parasite can be summarized to:\n",
    "* An anopheles mosquito bites a human, transferring the parasite\n",
    "* The parasite infects liver cells where it will grow\n",
    "* Once mature, these will rupture and release into red blood cells where they will reproduce asexually\n",
    "* Some will turn into gametocytes and while in the blood stream, can be ingested by another Anopheles mosquito.\n",
    "* These gametocytes will reproduce in the mosquitos stomach and produce thousands of parasites\n",
    "* These parasites will make way to the mosquitos salvitory glands where they can be injected in a human, starting the cycle over"

    "It is important to know that the malaria developing in the liver cells take a few days to mature, but can also lay dormant for up to several years after infecting its host. It can also take 10-18 days for gametocytes to reproduce and for the parasites to travel to the mosquitos salvitory glands."
